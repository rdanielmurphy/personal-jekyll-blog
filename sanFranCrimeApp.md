##Backstory
This app was created for a job interview to show my skills.  Didn't see much reason to put it on the app store.  I'd like to add a temporal element to the application at some point when I have some time.  Then if I can hook it up to some crime API then it might be worthy of the app store.

##Features
* See 2013 San Fran Crime data in either heatmap view or clustered pins view.  
* Filter crime type to narrow down your results to just the crime you care about.  
* Place cameras and police vehicles on problem areas.
